# Error correction #1 - Hamming Code

## Description

### Background information

The Hamming Code is used to correct errors, so-called bit flips, in data transmissions. Later in the description follows a detailed explanation of how it works.

In this Kata we will implement the Hamming Code with bit length 3; this has some advantages and disadvantages:

* [ + ] It's simple to implement
* [ + ] Compared to other versions of hamming code, we can correct more mistakes
* [ - ] The size of the input triples
